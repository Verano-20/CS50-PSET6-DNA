# CS50-PSET6-DNA
My solution for CS50x2020 problem set 6 - DNA.

A program in Python which will identify a person based on their DNA.

Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) are repeating short sequences of DNA nucleotides (e.g AGAT, AATG), where the number of times they repeat varies from person to person. By checking several STR counts from a sample against a known database of people's DNA, we can accurately determine the identity of the sample.
